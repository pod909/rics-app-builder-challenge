Take on Rics App Builder Challlenge by creating a production deployable APP 
based solely on the acceptance criteria in this repo using automation with 
no human in the loop.

As well as the application the build should produce automated testing that confirms that each of the acceptance criteria has been delivered.

The application and testing should be locally deployable as a self contained Docker container.
