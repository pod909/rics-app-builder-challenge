Take on Rics App Builder Challlenge by creating a production deployable APP 
based solely on the acceptance criteria in this repo using automation with 
no human in the loop.

As well as the application the build should produce automated testing that 
confirms that each of the acceptance criteria has been delivered.

The application and testing should be locally deployable as a self contained 
Docker container.

Bonus points for generating:
- Adoption material:
  - Release notes (markdown)
  - User manual (markdown + Mermaid + embedded images)
  - User training material including a quiz
- Go to market material:
  - Messaging plan listing key messages with intendend audience
  - Short (in 16:9 portrait and 4:3 landscape) video for each feature
